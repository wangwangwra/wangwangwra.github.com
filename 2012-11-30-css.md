### basic selector

+ tag selector

    html pages tags.
        
        # html
        <h1>HEADER</h1>
        # css
        h1 { color: red; font-size: 25px; }
        
+ class selector

    In html we can put tags into differet class, like

        # html
        <p class="red">class selector 1</p>
        <p class="green">class selector 2</p>
        # css
        .red { color: red; }
        .green { color: green; }

+ ID selector

    It's almost same with class selector. The difference is that ID selector
    can only be used once in a single html pages (class selector can be used
    more than once).

        # html
        <p id="one">ID selector 1</p>
        <p id="two">ID selector 2</p>
        # css
        #one { font-weight: bold; }
        #two { font-size: 30px; }

### complex selector

Mix up the three basic seletor, we can get more powerful and more accurate 
selection.

+ intersection selector

    Mix up two basic selector and get their intersection.
    The first must be *tag selector* and the second can be *class selector*
    or *ID selector*. Space is not allowed between the two selectors.

        h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, p { color: purple; font-size: 15px; }
        h2.special { text-decoration: underline; }

+ child selector
        
        # html
        <body>
            <p>Nested<span>SPAN</span>is here.</p>
            <span>Outer span</span>is there.
        </body>    
        # css
        p span { color: red; }
        span { color: blue; }
