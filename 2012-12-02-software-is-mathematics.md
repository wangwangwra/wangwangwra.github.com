+ mathematics is a language
+ languages are written with symbols
+ symbols are abstract ideas, more abstract more powerful
+ symbols need not be watched by humans to have meanings
+ computaions don't process electrons, computations process symbols
+ bits must be organized into syntax
+ the mathematical language my also be given some non mathematical interpretations
+ algorithms are manipulations of the uninterpreted symbols and their syntactic arrangement
+ algorithms and computations are not physical entities but contents
+ mathematicians have discovered a special category of algorithms called
universal algorithms, such as *universal Turing machine*, *instruction cycle*,
*Horn clauses*, *normal order B-reduction*
+ a program is data
+ most modern general purpose computers are built according to a common 
engineering pattern called the *stored program computer architecture*
+ we say software is mathematics because the execution of all computer programs
 is the execution of a universal mathematical algorithm. What the computer
does is a mathematical computation according to a mathematical algorithm.
