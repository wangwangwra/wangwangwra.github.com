llvm bundle outline [[llvm1]][llvm1]

+ bugpoint

        bugpoint is used to debug optimization passes or code generation 
        backends by narrowing down the given test case to the minimum number
        of passes and/or instructions that still cause a problem, whether it 
        is a crash or miscompilation. 

+ llvm-ar

        The archiver produces an archive containing the given LLVM bitcode 
        files, optionally with an index for faster lookup.

+ llvm-as

        The assembler transforms the human readable LLVM assembly to LLVM 
        bitcode.

+ llvm-dis

        The disassembler transforms the LLVM bitcode to human readable LLVM 
        assembly.

+ llvm-link

        llvm-link, not surprisingly, links multiple LLVM modules into a 
        single program.

+ lli

        lli is the LLVM interpreter, which can directly execute LLVM bitcode 
        (although very slowly...). For architectures that support it 
        (currently x86, Sparc, and PowerPC), by default, lli will function as 
        a Just-In-Time compiler (if the functionality was compiled in), and 
        will execute the code much faster than the interpreter.

+ llc

        llc is the LLVM backend compiler, which translates LLVM bitcode to a 
        native code assembly file or to C code (with the -march=c option).

+ opt

        opt reads LLVM bitcode, applies a series of LLVM to LLVM 
        transformations (which are specified on the command line), and then 
        outputs the resultant bitcode. The ‘opt -help‘ command is a good way 
        to get a list of the program transformations available in LLVM.

        opt can also be used to run a specific analysis on an input LLVM 
        bitcode file and print out the results. It is primarily useful for 
        debugging analyses, or familiarizing yourself with what an analysis 
        does.

+ llvm-config

        llvm-config can print the compiler flags, linker flags and object 
        libraries needed to link against llvm.
